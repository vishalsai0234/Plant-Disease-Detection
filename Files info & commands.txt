Files Contains:

1. "home_page.jpeg" image file (used in streamlit)

2. "main.py" python file (used for prediction of leaf images in streamlit)

3. "model_test.ipynb" google collab notebook

4. "model_train.ipynb" google collab notebook

5. "training_hist.json" history of model training

6. "Plant_Disease_Detection_Report.pdf" report for this project


Commands:

1. Open jupyter notebook/ google collab & run the "model_train.ipynb" file

2. After running successfully, you get new file called "trained_model.keras" in the folder

3. Then open a terminal from the folder which contains this files

2. Type "streamlit run main.py" & run it in terminal to predict the type of leaf image with disease

3. If you getting error then proceed with using following commands in terminal (to create new environment):
  - conda create -n tf_env python=3.10
  - conda activate tf_env
  - conda install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
  - streamlit run main.py


Now, terminal automatically open web browser for streaming.
